# Self Assessment / Validation

To enforce code quality, tests have been implemented in each microservice. They ensure the exposed API and the internal business logic work as expected.

In `session-service` and `auth-service` tests leverage the [Mocha](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mocha) API with [Chai](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai) as BDD assertion library, while `profile-service` makes use of [ScalaTests](https://www.scalatest.org/) and [Akka Route TestKit](https://doc.akka.io/libraries/akka-http/current/routing-dsl/testkit.html).

Furthermore, architectural tests are added inside each typescript microservice, except for the Frontend Service, to verify the architecture strictly follows the Clean Architecture. For these tests, the [Dependency Cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) framework has been adopted. The tests check that the dependencies between the code modules are respected:

- The Domain layer should not depend on any other layer;
- The Application layer can only depend on the Domain layer;
- The Infrastructure layer can only depend on the Application layer and Domain layer.

```
module.exports = {
  forbidden: [
    {
      name: 'no-unreachable-from-domain',
      comment: 'The domain layer should not depend on any other layer',
      severity: 'error',
      from: {
        path: '^(src/domain)'
      },
      to: {
        pathNot: '^(src/domain)'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'no-unreachable-from-application',
      comment: 'The application layer should only depend on the domain layer',
      severity: 'error',
      from: {
        path: '^(src/application)'
      },
      to: {
        pathNot: '^(src/domain)|^(src/application)|^(node_modules/axios)|^(node_modules/js-sha256)'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'no-unreachable-from-infrastructure',
      comment: 'The infrastructure layer should only depend on the domain and application layers',
      severity: 'error',
      from: {
        path: '^(src/infrastructure)'
      },
      to: {
        pathNot: '^(src/domain)|^(src/application)|^(src/infrastructure)|^(node_modules/axios)|^(node_modules/socket.io)'
      }
    },
    {
      name: 'no-circular',
      severity: 'warn',
      comment:
        'This dependency is part of a circular relationship. You might want to revise ' +
        'your solution (i.e. use dependency inversion, make sure the modules have a single responsibility) ',
      from: {},
      to: {
        circular: true
      }
    },
    ...
```

The configuration for the Authentication Service is similar to the one above, with the only difference being the paths to the modules.
</Summary>

## End-to-End Testing

To validate the whole system, end-to-end tests have been implemented.
They are written in Typescript and use the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) library to interact with the Frontend Service and the microservices.

In combination with [Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) and [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), the tests are executed automatically on every release of any microservice. This ensures that the Let's Stream It system is always working as expected.
