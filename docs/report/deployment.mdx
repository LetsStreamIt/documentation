# Deployment

It is possible to deploy *Let's Stream It* by either running locally the single services one by one or more easily through [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

- To run each single microservice locally follow the instruction given inside each repository `README` ([Session Service](https://github.com/LetsStreamIt/session-service), [Profile Service](https://github.com/LetsStreamIt/profile-service), [Auth Service](https://github.com/LetsStreamIt/auth-service) and [Frontend Service](https://github.com/LetsStreamIt/frontend-service)). Also make sure to run the [MongoDB container](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo) on port 27017;
- To deploy all services at once navigate to the [Bootstrap repository](https://github.com/LetsStreamIt/bootstrap) and follow the provided indications.

In both the cases, the microservices have the following dependencies. In the `docker-compose` file they are guaranteed to be deployed in this sequence by leveraging [healthchecks](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#healthcheck) and [`depends_on`](https://docs.docker.com/reference/compose-file/services/#depends_on) attributes.
